### Intro to VPN
- remote users
- site-to-site connectivity
- secure,

### VPN Protocols
- part of the connection in which data is encapsulated is referred to as Tunnel.

1. PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)
    - enables PPP to encapsulate packets within IP packets.
    - older than L2TP and ipsec.
    - consumes less resources.
    - secure extension of PPP
    - operated on L2 of OSI model, allowing different N/W protocols to run over PPTP tunnel.
    - supports 2 separate technologies for - authenticating (EAP - Extensible Authentication protocol and CHAP - Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol).

- **EAP**
    - was designed for PPTP, works within PPP's authentication protocol.
    - provides framework for different authentication methods.
    - includes, passwords, chalange-response tokens, PKI certs.
- **CHAP**
    - a three part handshaking procedure.
    - once link established, server sends a challenge to client, client responds by a calculated value, using one-way hash. server checks response against its own calculated hash.
    - it repeats this process periodically. (re-authentication), provide robust security.




2. L2TP ( Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol), is often combined with IPSec to achieve a high level of security.
    - enhancement of PPTP, improved version of PPTP.
    - operates on L2 (datalink layer), like PPTP.
    - considered as less secure than IPsec.
    - supports both EAP and CHAP. and more .... , MS-CHAP, PAP, SPAP, Kerberos

- **MS-CHAP**
    - Microsoft-specific extension to CHAP
    - mostly consistent with CHAP, some basic differences.
        - response packet is in format compatible with MS networking.
        - does not require the authenticator to store a clear-text pwd.
        - provides authenticator-controlled authentication retry.
        - defines a set of reason-for-failure codes.(in failure packet's messages field).

- **PAP**
    - Password Authentication Protocol, basic form of authentication.
    - tramission is clear txt as well as unencrypted.
    - http uses PAP.
    - no longer used.
-**SPAP**
    - Shiva Password Authentication Protocol, proprietary.
    - bit more secure than PAP, username/pwd are encrypted, when sent.
    - susceptible to playback attacks, because SPAP uses same reversible encryption method.
-**Kerberos**
    - works by sending messages back and forth b/w the client and server.
    - actual pwd is never sent (not even hashed)
    - username is sent.
    - server gets stored hash of pwd, and uses it as encryption key to encrypt data and sent it back to client.
    - client then uses pwd entered by user and uses that as a key to decrypt.
    - if pwd is wrong (entered by user), it will never get decrypted.
    - Authentication happens with UDP on port 88.


    - After user's username  is sent to AS (authentication service), AS will use the hash of user password  that is stored as secret key to encrypt the following 2 messages that get sent to client -
        1. **Message A:** Contains client/TGS(Ticket Granting Service) sessions key encrypted with secret key of client.
        2. **Message B:** Contains TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) that includes client ID, client network address and validity period.

    - client attempts to decrypt Message A with secret key generated by hash of user's entered pwd.
    - if decryption works, messageA's TGS key can be used for communication with TGS. MessageB is encrypted with TGS secret key and cannot be decrypted by client.

    - now user is authenticated to system, but when user requests a service, more authorization/comm required with more messages. When requesting services, client sends 2 messages to TGS.  
        3. **Message C:**  composed of TGT from message B and the ID of the requested service.  
        4. **Message D:** Authenticator (clientID and timestamp), encrypted used client/TGS session key.  
    - TGS retrieves message B from message C. decrypts message B usign TGS secret key -> resulting "Client/TGS session key". using this key TGS decrypts message D and sends following to client.  
        5. **Message E:** Client-to-server ticket (includes clientiD, client nw addr, validity period and client/server session key), encrypted using the service's secret key.  
        6. **Message F:** client/server session key encrypted with client TGS session key.  


    - on receiving E and F from TGS, client has enough info to authenticate itself to service server (SS). client connects to SS and send 2 messages  
       6. **Message E:** from above step, encrypted with servers secret key.  
       7. **Message G:** a new authenticator, which includes clientID and timestamp - encrypted using client/server session key.  

    - SS decrypts the ticket (E) using its own key -> retrieves client/server secret key. using session key, SS decrypts the Authenticator and sends following messages to client - to confirm identify and willingness to server the client.  
        8. **Message H:** Timestamp found in clients Authenticator.  
    - client decrypts the confirmation (H) using session key. and checks wether the timestamp is correct. -> yes -> trus the server and start issueing service requests. server provides the requested service.  

- Kerberos terms:
    - **Principal**
    - **Authentication Service (AS)**
    - **Ticket Granting Service (TGS)**
    - **Key Distribution Centre (KDC)**

    - **Realm:** a boundary within an org. each realm has its own AS and TGS.
    - **Remote TGS**
    - **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)**
    - **Ticket:**
    - **Session Key:**
    - **AUthenticator:**


### IPSec - Internet Protocol Security.
- used for VPN.
- set of protocols - to support sec exchange of packets.
- two encryption modes, Transport (encrypts data but not header) and Tunnel (encrypts both header and data).
- both sending and receiving devices must share a key (single).
- Two protocols -
    - **AH (Authentication Header):**
    - **ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload):** - can be used with confidentiality only, authentication only or both.
    - both can be applied to single packet.
    - other protocols, IKE (internet key exchange).
    - ISAKMP, provides framework for auth and key exchange.
    - DH public keys will be used to encrypt data being sent bw two endpoints.
    - **quick mode**
    - **Aggressive mode**


### SSL/TLS - Secure Sockets Layers/ Transport Layer Security
- VPN thorough web portal
- SSL handshake process is needed to establish secure/encrypted connection:
    1.


### VPN Solutions
- Cisco Solutions
    - uses 3DES encryption., but AES is preferred and recommended.
    - can handle packets larger than 500bytes.
    - can create upto 60 new virtual tunnels/sec.

- Openswan
    - open source, Linux OS, free, uses IPSec.
    - remote user or site-to-site, supports wireless.
    - does not support NAT.
