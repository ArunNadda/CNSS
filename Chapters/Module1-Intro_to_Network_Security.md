## Module 1 - Intro_to_Network_Security

### Basics
- ipv4, ipv6
- dns
- ports
- TCP/IP

### Analyzing Network Traffic
- using wireshark
    - analyze web Traffic
    - analyze Telnet Traffic (un encrypted, can see all user/pwds)

### Basic N/W utils
- ping (ICMP)
- netstat (netstat -tulpn)
- tracert(traceroute)
- ipconfig/ip/ifconfig


### OSI Model
- Application
- Presentation
- Session ()
- Transport (TCP/UDP)
- Network (Routes, IP/ARP/ICMP)
- Data Link (MAC/LLC)
- Physical (cable/nic)



### Thread Classification - Three types - categorized attacks by based on what they actually do
- Intrusion
   - hacking, cracking, these are using to simply deny uesrs to access the system.
   - using security flaws in OS/app, using security misconfigurations
   - social engg, war driving to hack wireless networks

- Blocking/DoS
   - DDoS


- Malware
  - most common threat to any systems.
  - designed to spread on their own
  - wildly spread
  - example - virus - replicate and spread
      - can spread using addressbook/emails
      - can cause networkshutdowns/heavy network Traffic
  - Trojan horse
      - secretly downloads a virus or malware.
      - more likely to be found in illegitimate softwares or pirated copies of softwares.
  - Spywares
      - increasing at pace
      - spies on computer
      - can track web-cookies, files etc
  - keyloggers


### Security Terminology
- firewall
- proxy server
- IDS
- Access Control
    - authentication
- Non-Repudiation
- Least privilege
- CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
    - Confidentiality: drive encryption, good passwords, MFA
    - Integrity: digital signature
    - Availability: backup/HA

- Hackers:
    - White Hat Hackers
    - Black Hat Hackers
    - Grey Hat Hackers


### Approaches of Network Security
- Perimeter Security Approach:
- Layered Security Approach:
- Hybrid Security Approach:


### Law and Network security
-
