## NIST Standards
**NIST SP 800-14** - Generally Accepted Principles and Practices for Security IT Systems
- describes common security Principles that should be addressed within security policies
- describe 8 Principles and 14 practices used to develop sec policies
- 8 Principles:
    - Computer security supports the mission of org.
    - Computer security is an integral element of sound management
    - Computer  security should be cost-effective
    - System owners have security responsibilities outside their own Organization.
    - Computer security responsibilities and accountabilities should be made explicit.
    - requires a comprehensive and integrated approach.
    - should be periodically reassessed
    - is constrained by societal factors.


**NIST SP 800-35 - guide to IT security services.**
- six phases of IT security life cycle are defined
    - **Phase 1: Initiation.** org is looking to implement a IT security service, device or process.
    - **Phase 2: Assessment.** involves determining and describing the org's current security posture.  should use quantifiable metrices.
    - **Phase 3: Solution.** This is where various solutions are valuated and one or more are selected.
    - **Phase 4: Implementation.** IT security service, device or process is implemented.
    - **Phase 5: Operations.** is the ongoing operation and maintenance of sec services, device, or process implemented in P4.
    - **Phase 6: Closeout.** when a system is replaced by newer/better system.


**NIST SP 800-30 Rev.1 - Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments**
- is a standard for conducting Risk Assessments.
- provides guidance on how to conduct it.
- 9 steps
    - **Step 1.** System Characterization
    - **Step 2.** Threat Identification
    - **Step 3.** Vulnerability Identification
    - **Step 4.** Control Analysis
    - **Step 5.** Likelihood Determination
    - **Step 6.** Impact Analysis
    - **Step 7.** Risk Determination
    - **Step 8.** Control Recommendations
    - **Step 9.** Results documentation.

## GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- EU LAW created in 2016
- deals with data privacy
- applied to any entity (Business, govt, agency etc), that either collects data or processes it.
- Even if org is not within EU, if it has EU data, GDPR applied.


## PCI DSS - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.
- is a proprietary Information security standard for orgs that handle cardholder info for major credit/debit cards such as VISA and MasterCard
- several goals
- Requirements:
1.1 FW and router system should be installed to protect cardholder info.
    - Program the standards of firewall and router to:
    1. Perform testing when configs change.
    2. Identify all connections to cardholder info
    3. Review config rules every 6 months.
    - Configure firewall to prohibit unauthorised access from networks and hosts and deny direct public access any info about the cardholder.
    - Additionally, install firewall software on all computers that access the orgs PCI compliance network.

1.2 Change all default pwds.


2.1 Cardholder data (any personal info about the cardholder that is found on the payment card) can never be saved by a merchant.
- includes  preserving encrypted authentication data after authorization.
- Merchants can only display the max of the first 6 and last 4 digits of PAN (primary account number).
- If merchant stores PAN, ensure that data is secured by saving it in a cryptographic form.

2.2 all info is encrypted when transmitting the data across public nw.

3.1 Computer viruses can spread in many ways, but mainly through emails and other online activities. Merchants computer should have latest antivirus software defs (and on all computers in nw)

3.2 must install vendor-provided security patches within a month of the release. security alert programs, scanning services or software may be used to signal the merchant of any vulnerable info.

4.1
- must limit accessibility of cardholder info.
- Install pwds and other security measurements to limit employees access to cardholder data.
- Only employees who must access the info to complete their job, should be allowed.

4.2
- assign each user an unreadable pwd used to access the cardholder data.

4.3
- Monitor the physical access to cardholder data.
- do not allow unauthorized persons the opportunity to retrieve the info by getting physical/digital.
- destroy all outdated info.
- maintain a visitor log and save for atleast 3 months.

5.1
- keep system activity logs that trace all activity and review daily.
- info in logs is useful in event of a security breach
- to trace employee activities and locate the source of violation.
- Record entries should have at least - user, event, date n time, success or failure, source of affected data  and system components.

5.2
- Each quarter, use a wireless analyser to check for wireless access points to prevent unauthoriized access.
- scan internal/external nw to identify any possible vulnerable areas in the system.
- install sw to recognise any modification by unauthorised personnel.
- ensure that all IDS/IPS engines are up to date.
